Personal Website — Lily Zheng

Quick start:

Run a simple local server from the project folder:

```bash
cd "personal website"
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Files:
- `index.html` — Welcome / About
- `projects.html` — Projects list
- `experience.html` — Experience
- `css/styles.css` — Styles
- `js/main.js` — Minimal interactions

Next steps:
- Replace placeholder content with your real bio, projects, and experience.
- Add screenshots in `assets/` and link them from the project cards.
- Optionally initialize a git repo and deploy (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
